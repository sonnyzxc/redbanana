# Inspiration
There currently exists many issues with hybrid working.

# Purpose 
Address these issues in a 'fun' way and implement some aspect of gamification to encourage demotivated employees. 

# Build Progression
Started off with ReactJS + Django stack, but soon changed to just Django due to the steep learning curve and lack of time.

# Challenges
Effectively collaborating on the codebase due to our lack of experience in webdev.

# Accomplishments
Successfully programming up:
- rotating circles using matrices
- client-sided stopwatch
- taking the courage to delete half of our codebase (very couragous ğŸ˜±)

# Lessons Learnt
- Flask > React for fast development 
- Use more familiar tech if under time constraint

# What's next?
- Catch up on sleep ğŸ˜´ğŸ˜´ğŸ˜´
- Participate in next year's ICHack
- Practice more webdev skills by doing projects
